### Progress

After last week's presentations, we adopted some of the other groups techniques. We created a streamlined process using sklearn (pipeline) that uses stratified k-fold (5folds 3 repeats), light gbm, and eliminated all of the highly correlated varaibles. We also used extreme dimensionality reduction and tried a model that only uses the first 15 variables. We also attempted to use h20 autoML models but did not have any success there


### Moving forward

Tune a deep learning module to ensemble with our light GBM model (autoencoder, MLP) etc. Try out some other different techniques
