## MCMF EDA Report April 28

## Team: Waterbears

## We continued progress on our Exploratory Data Analysis. This included mapping accessibility as an aggregate of various features in the data to the Chicago community areas, in addition to initial exploration of some other features.

## Over the next week, we will wrap up our exploration of the data, and create a slide deck to present our findings in the next class.
