# Kaggle competition

## Team: Matt Holleran Meyer

## Methodology

We accomplished all of last weeks previous goals by implementing more optimal RF, XGboost, and mlp models. We used grid search to find these optimal paramters and achieved better metrics across the board. We also implemented CV across our experiments to attempt to eliminate some of the overfitting that may be occuring when we train our experiments. Finally, we experimented using PCA with some of the features to see if we could create some new features that help the model perform better. 

Next week, we are hoping to experiment with ensembling and auto encoders to create new features.

## Current Progress

Ranked five on the leaderboard, MSE down .14 from last week.
