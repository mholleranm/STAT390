Most of this week's work went towards the Kaggle competetion, but we made some progress in our EDA as well.
We cleaned a lot of the data and removed some unimportant columns and missing values.
We looked at longitude and latitude data to seee the distribution of programs as well as identify some outliers. 
We then plotted long and lat by also changing the color based on program price, to see if there was a visual connection between price and location.
Finally, we worked on visualizing the location data overlayed on an actual map of Chicago.
