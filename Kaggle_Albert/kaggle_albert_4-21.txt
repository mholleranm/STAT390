Kaggle Prediction Problem - Albert Wang 4-21-2023 Report

Performed some brief EDA, noted that half of the data contain missing values. 
Attempted to use subset selection for linear regression,
 but the feature space caused overflow, even for forward stepwise. 
Alternative strategy was to identify the features with the highest correlation with y. 
This yielded a number of features that had R-squared of 1.
However, modeling with them created errors.
Next steps:
Scale features, and then idenitfy the most correlated features with y. Use those to create a model.
Consider other models for prediction.
